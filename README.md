# Time-Series-Prediction-and-Anomaly-Detection
This repository hosts a comprehensive project aimed at time-series prediction using neural networks and the application of three distinct anomaly detection approaches across various datasets.

## Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Time-Series Prediction: Developing proficiency in time-series prediction through the implementation of neural networks.
- Anomaly Detection: Implementing anomaly detection methods with the application of different datasets.

It intends to implement time-series prediction with neural networks and three approaches(decomposition, prediction, and clustering) for anomaly detection with different data sets. The time-series prediction with neural networks is the base to conduct the prediction-based anomaly detection in this project.

For each anomaly detection task, it includes a chain of sub-tasks from exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, model building, prediction towards anomaly detection.

## Project Structure

The project encompasses various tasks structured as follows:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project kicks off with in-depth exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the datasets.
- Feature Extraction: Following EDA, the project focuses on feature extraction, extracting valuable features to support prediction and anomaly detection.
- Model Building: The core phase of the project involves constructing models for time-series prediction and anomaly detection.
- Prediction: Applying the developed models to make predictions based on the data.
- Anomaly Detection: Utilizing the predictive models for the purpose of anomaly detection within the datasets.

## Libraries Utilized

This project makes use of various Python libraries to facilitate data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning tasks. The key libraries include:

- Pandas
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- Keras and TensorFlow
- Additional Common Libraries: Complementary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and more are employed for various data processing and visualization tasks.
